# ns3-propagation-models
This project investigates the influence of different propagation models in ns-3 on Wi-Fi performance.  
To reduce build and run time, I recommend using the ``--optimized-build`` option.  
For more information see the [official ns-3 tutorial](https://www.nsnam.org/docs/release/3.40/tutorial/html/index.html).

The results of the project can be found [here](https://github.com/SophiaNow/ns3-propagation-models/blob/main/Investigating_the_Influence_of_Propagation_Loss-Nowicki.pdf).
